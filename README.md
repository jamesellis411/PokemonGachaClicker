# 🎰 PokéGacha — The Pokémon Capsule Clicker

A **Java + JavaFX desktop game** inspired by Pokémon and the **gachapon capsule machines** of Japan.  
Players earn coins, spin for random Pokémon, and build their collection — capturing the excitement of opening a gachapon capsule with every click.

This project demonstrates:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File I/O and persistent data management

## 🎰 Inspiration

PokéGacha was inspired by the **gachapon machines** found throughout Japan — small vending machines that dispense collectible toys in random capsules.  

After visiting Japan and rediscovering a love for Pokémon, I wanted to recreate that same feeling digitally:  
the sound of a coin drop, the twist of the dial, and the surprise of seeing which Pokémon pops out of the capsule.  

PokéGacha brings that joy to life as a clicker game — earn coins, spin for Pokémon, and grow your capsule collection one click at a time.

## 🧭 Coming Soon
